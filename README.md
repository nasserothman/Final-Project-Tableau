# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Review the raw dataset for Airbnb in NYC.
Analyze the data
Look for insights to visualize

## Process
### I chose Option 2 for this project: AIRBNB
### Connected the AIRBNB data to Tableau
### Detected different data types in the AIRBNB data
### Built at least 6 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset.
### Created a dashboard
### Created a Story

## Results
I chose option 2. went with the Airbnb Data Set. We want to see where are the best neighbourhoods, Airbnb Hosts and best bang for your buck. We concluded that Manhatten and Brooklyn are the best places to stay in in.
First visualization: Map of NYC and showing the average prices based on Zipcodes. Chose this because we want to see the prices per zipcode and look to find the cheapest and most expensive places to rent an airbnb unit. The 2nd visualization shows the top rated neighbourhoods in NYC. We saw the Brooklyn was the most favorable neighbourhood followed by Manhattan. The third visualization shows the Room typers per neighbourhood. Although Brooklyn was rated the number one neighbourhood, Manhatten had the highest amount of Airbnb units. The fourth visualization shows the average prices from the years 2008 - 2015. Prices dropped in 2015 compared to 2008 mainly due to the number of units comming into the market. The fifth Visualization shows the average number of reviews in each neighbourhood with different room types. We see that Private rooms are the most rated in all neighbourhoods which suggests this would be the highest frequency of bookings in Airbnb. The sixth visualization shows the top 10 airbnb hosts in NYC of all the time (2008-2015) and the number one host was in Manhatten with an average price of $50. This shows that no matter what your prices are, the high review rating is based on the number of reviews you receive as an Airbnb Host which sugegst how experienced the Host is.
